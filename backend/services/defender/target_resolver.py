"""Dynamic target resolution for the defender.

Replaces Trident's hardcoded ``determine_target_info()`` IP-prefix map
(``172.31.0.*`` -> server, ``172.30.0.*`` -> compromised). Hosts and their IPs
are dynamic — assigned by network-topology per CIDR — so resolution is done
against the running topology plus Docker labels at call time:

* a planner ``target_host`` (name) or an alert's victim IP is mapped to a
  defended host, then to its live container;
* alerts whose target matches no defended host are dropped by the policy gate
  (surfaced as a counter on ``/api/defender/status``).
