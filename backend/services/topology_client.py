Topology Client for Agent Manager

Single source of truth for topology data is the network-topology plugin, which
owns topology.json and exposes it over HTTP (TOPOLOGY_PLUGIN_URL). These helpers
read/write topology data *exclusively* through that API — the agent-manager has
no local topology file store. Agent assignments live in topology.json as
`host.agents` and are derived on demand (see agent_lifecycle), never persisted
separately.
